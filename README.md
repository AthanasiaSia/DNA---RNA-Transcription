# DNA to RNA Transcription

A simple Python tool that converts a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence and counts the occurrences of each RNA base.

## Description

This script allows the user to input a DNA sequence and outputs the transcribed RNA sequence.  
It also provides a count of each base (A, U, G, C) in the resulting RNA sequence.  
The program continues to accept sequences until the user types `exit`.

## How to Use
Example:
Enter your DNA sequence or exit: ATGCTT
Output RNA: AUGCUU

Base counts:
A : 1
U : 2
G : 1
C : 1
Enter your DNA sequence or exit: exit
Exiting program.
